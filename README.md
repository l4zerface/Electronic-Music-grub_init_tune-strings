# Electronic-Music-grub_init_tune-strings
A collection of electronic music tracks in GRUB's init_tune format. Kraftwerk, Jeff Mill's "The Bells", Aphex Twin, Donna Summer, with more additions to be added in the future.

Place the string into /etc/default/grub, use "grub-mkconfig" to regenerate your GRUB configuration file and reboot.

[Note : I have not tested these strings on hardware. They were created using BreadMaker's amazing GRUB_INIT_TUNE tester and were not tested further.]
